# ARM-like-CPU

Developed a RISC-based CPU microarchitecture from scratch, including Controller and Datapath modules 
• Implemented an instruction set supporting Data processing (ADD, SUB, AND, ORR), Memory 
operations (STR, LDR), and Branching (B) with conditional execution based on ARM architecture 
• Designed and implemented controller and Datapath modules, including decoder, conditional 
logic, multiplexers (MUX), adder, register file, ALU, extender, and flip-flops (flop) to handle instruction 
decoding, control signal generation, and data flow execution
